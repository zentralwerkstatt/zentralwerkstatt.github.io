                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text small">We revisit Johanna Drucker's question, “Is there a digital art history?” in the light of the emergence of large-scale, transformer-based vision models. Such models have “seen” huge swathes of online visual culture, biased towards an exclusionary visual canon, and they continuously solidify and concretize this canon through their already widespread application in all aspects of digital life. We use a large-scale vision model to propose a new critical methodology that acknowledges the epistemic entanglement of neural network and dataset. We propose that digital art history is here, but not in the way we expected: rather, it has emerged as a crucial route to understanding, exposing, and critiquing the visual ideology of contemporary AI models.

                    <span class="text small">Can we, as humans, rely on our capability to decode systems of representation, such as artistic descriptions of the world in text or image, to understand neural networks? The two technical papers at the center of this essay shed some light on this fundamentally humanist question. Concretely, they suggest that we are currently witnessing a turn toward postsymbolic computation, a paradigm under which nothing is language and everything is language at the same time.</span>

                    <span class="text large">AI &amp; Society, 2021</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text small">We propose that machine vision systems are inherently biased not only because they rely on biased datasets but also because their perceptual topology, their specific way of representing the world, gives rise to a new class of bias that we call perceptual bias. We show how perceptual bias affects the interpretability of machine vision systems in particular, by means of a close reading of a visualization technique called feature visualization. We conclude that dataset bias and perceptual bias both need to be considered in the critical analysis of machine vision systems and propose to understand critical machine vision as an important transdisciplinary challenge, situated at the interface of computer science and visual studies.

                    <span class="text small">We examine how generative artificial intelligence produces a new politics of visual culture through the technique of semantic compression. Semantic compression, we argue, is an inhuman and invisual technique, yet it is still caught in a paradox that is ironically all too human: the consistent reproduction of whiteness as a latent feature of dominant visual culture.using Open AI's failed efforts to "debias" their DALL·E system as a critical opening to interrogate how the system dissolves and reconstitutes politically and economically salient human concepts like race.
